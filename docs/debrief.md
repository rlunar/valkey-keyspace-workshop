# Mission Debrief & Q&A (7 minutes)

## 🌟 Key Mission Accomplishments

1. **Strings**: Lightning-fast caching with TTL and atomic operations
2. **Hashes**: Structured session management with partial updates
3. **Lists**: Reliable task queues with priority and blocking operations  
4. **Sorted Sets**: Real-time leaderboards with range queries and rankings
5. **Lua Scripts**: Atomic rate limiting with sliding window algorithm
6. **Analytics Combo**: Counters + HyperLogLog + Sorted Sets for comprehensive metrics

## 🚀 Advanced Patterns Discovered

- **Atomic operations**: Preventing race conditions with Lua scripts
- **Memory efficiency**: HyperLogLog for unique counting at scale
- **Time-based patterns**: TTL, time windows, and temporal analytics
- **Pattern matching**: Efficient key operations with wildcards
- **Blocking operations**: Real-time processing with `BRPOP` and similar
