__Mission 1Ô∏è‚É£: Hyperdrive Caching with Strings__

# üöÄ Bonus Challenges [Optional]

## **Challenge 1: Cache Invalidation Pattern**

*"Your lack of cache invalidation disturbs me" - Vader*

Objective: Use pattern matching to clear all Imperial fleet caches at once

Validation: All following commands should return `(nil)`:

```bash
GET imperial_fleet:tatooine
```

```bash
GET imperial_fleet:hoth
```

```bash
GET imperial_fleet:endor
```

Hint Commands: [`SCAN`](https://valkey.io/commands/scan/), [`UNLINK`](https://valkey.io/commands/unlink/)

## **Challenge 2: Atomic Updates**

*"I find your race condition disturbing"*

Objective: Update fleet strength only if the current value matches expected value

SetUp

```bash
SET imperial_fleet:hoth:atat 7 EX 600
```

Response:
> OK

Now, after the Rogue Squadron took down 2 of them we need to update the value but verify if its the previous value (7), we don't want to misscount how many more AT-AT are still out there destroying power generators.

Hint Commands: [`GET`](https://valkey.io/commands/get/), [`SET`](https://valkey.io/commands/set/) with conditions

## **Challenge 3: Bulk Operations**

*"These are not the slow operations you're looking for"*

Objective: Set multiple fleet positions in a single atomic operation, instead of doing 3 separate commands to store or retrieve, how would you do it at once?

Original:

```bash
SET imperial_fleet:tatooine "3 Star Destroyers, sector 7G" EX 300
```

Response:
> OK

Cache multiple systems üìã

```bash
SET imperial_fleet:hoth "1 Super Star Destroyer, 6 Star Destroyers" EX 600
```

Response:
> OK

Cache multiple systems üìã

```bash
SET imperial_fleet:endor "Shield generator station, 2 Star Destroyers" PX 300
```

Response:
> OK

Hint Commands: [`MSET`](https://valkey.io/commands/mset/), [`MGET`](https://valkey.io/commands/mget/)

## **Challenge 4: Conditional Caching**

*"Only store this intelligence if no one else has reported it"*

Objective: Cache fleet data only if the key doesn't exist yet

You can always do the following commands, but multiple Pilots might be reporting and overwriting the same information:

Pilot Red Five reports üìã

```bash
SET imperial_fleet:endor "1 Super Star Destroyer, 6 Star Destroyers" EX 600
```

Response:
> OK

Pilot Rogue Two also reports üìã

```bash
SET imperial_fleet:endor "1 Super Star Destroyer, 6 Star Destroyers" EX 600
```

Response:
> OK

How can you prevent this?

Hint Commands: [`SET`](https://valkey.io/commands/set/) with `NX` option, [`SETNX`](https://valkey.io/commands/setnx/)
