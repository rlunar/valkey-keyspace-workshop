__Mission 1Ô∏è‚É£: Hyperdrive Caching with Strings__

# üõ∏ Common Caching Patterns Deep Dive

Explore the different Caching mechanisms, pros, cons and caveats.

## **1. Cache-Aside (Lazy Loading)**

*"R2-D2 only loads Death Star plans when Luke actually needs them"*

**How it works:**
- Application checks cache first
- On cache miss ‚ùå, fetch from database üíΩ
- Store result in cache ‚ö° for next time
- Application manages all cache operations üß†

![Cache-Aside](../../../static/img/caching_03-cache-aside.png)

**Best for:** Read-heavy workloads ‚ôªÔ∏è, unpredictable access patterns

__1. Check cache first__

```bash
GET death_star_plans:weakness_analysis
```

Response:
> (nil)

__2. Cache miss - fetch from "database" and cache result__

```bash
SET death_star_plans:weakness_analysis "Thermal exhaust port vulnerability confirmed" EX 3600
```

Response:
> OK

__3. Subsequent reads hit cache__

```bash
GET death_star_plans:weakness_analysis
```

**Pros:** ‚úÖ
- Only cache what's actually needed
- Cache failures don't break the application
- Data consistency is manageable

**Cons:** ‚ùó 
- Initial requests are slow (cache miss penalty)
- Application code complexity increases (Developers test as Jedi Masters)
- Potential for stale data (Like ancient languages that haven't been spoken for thousands of years)

## **2. Write-Through**

*"C-3PO updates both his memory banks and the central Rebel database simultaneously"*

**How it works:**

- Write to cache and database at the same time üîÑ
- Every write operation updates both stores üîÉ
- Reads always hit cache (if cache is available) 
- Strong consistency between cache and database üí™

![Write-Through](../../../static/img/caching_02-write-through.png)

**Best for:** Applications requiring data consistency, moderate write loads

Write-through simulation (application would handle database write)

__1. Update both cache and database in same operation__

```bash
SET rebel_base_location:hoth "Echo Base, coordinates 39.5991 N, 2.9238 E" EX 7200
```

Response:
> OK

__2. Reads are always fast and consistent__

```bash
GET rebel_base_location:hoth
```

Response:
> "Echo Base, coordinates 39.5991 N, 2.9238 E"

**Pros:** ‚úÖ
- Data consistency guaranteed
- Fast reads after writes
- Simple read logic

**Cons:** ‚ùó
- Write latency increases (dual writes)
- Cache stores data that might never be read
- More complex failure handling

---

## **3. Write-Behind (Write-Back)**

*"Han Solo updates his pilot log in the Falcon's computer first, syncs with Rebel command later"*

**How it works:**

- Write to cache immediately
- Database write happens asynchronously later
- Fastest write performance
- Risk of data loss if cache fails before sync

![Write-back](../../../static/img/caching_04-write-back.png)

**Best for:** Write-heavy applications, acceptable eventual consistency

__1. Write-behind pattern - immediate cache update__

```bash
SET pilot_log:han_solo "Completed Kessel Run in 12 parsecs" EX 1800
```

Response:
> OK

Application separately handles async database write

__2. Cache provides immediate read access__

```bash
GET pilot_log:han_solo
```

Response:
> "Completed Kessel Run in 12 parsecs"

**Pros:** ‚úÖ
- Fastest write performance
- Reduced database load
- Can batch database writes for efficiency

**Cons:** ‚ùó
- Risk of data loss
- Complex consistency management
- Difficult error handling

## Two hard problems in computer science: Naming things and Cache invalidation

![Cache-invalidation](../../../static/img/caching_05-consistency-issue.png)

When multiple application servers are concurrently using the distributed Cache mechanism, an out of sequence error might occur, when dealing with shared resources it is important to acquire a lock in the Key that needs to be updated in order to prevent storing stale data after an update.
