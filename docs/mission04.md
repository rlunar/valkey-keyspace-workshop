## Mission 4: Death Star Leaderboards with Sorted Sets (12 minutes)
*"That's no moon... that's a sorted set!"*

### ðŸŒŸ What are Leaderboards?
Leaderboards are like the Imperial Academy's pilot rankings - automatically sorted lists where performance determines position. Whether tracking TIE fighter kill counts or Podracing lap times, sorted sets maintain real-time rankings without manual sorting.

**Why Use Leaderboards?**
- **Gamification**: Drive engagement through competition
- **Performance tracking**: Monitor metrics in real-time
- **Automatic sorting**: No manual rank calculations needed
- **Range queries**: Find top performers or specific score ranges
- **Efficient updates**: O(log N) insertions and updates

**Leaderboard Applications:**
- **Gaming**: Player scores and achievements  
- **E-commerce**: Product ratings and reviews
- **Analytics**: Performance metrics and KPIs
- **Social**: User reputation and activity scores

### The Challenge
The Empire needs to rank TIE fighter pilots by their hit accuracy. Even storm troopers deserve recognition (when they actually hit something).

### Valkey Solution: Sorted Sets
```bash
# Add pilots with accuracy scores (score is the ranking value)
ZADD pilot_leaderboard 98.5 "Darth_Vader"
ZADD pilot_leaderboard 99.9 "Luke_Skywalker"  
ZADD pilot_leaderboard 87.3 "Wedge_Antilles"
ZADD pilot_leaderboard 12.3 "Stormtrooper_TK421"
ZADD pilot_leaderboard 15.7 "Stormtrooper_TK422"
ZADD pilot_leaderboard 94.2 "Biggs_Darklighter"

# Get top pilots (highest scores first)
ZREVRANGE pilot_leaderboard 0 4 WITHSCORES

# Get bottom performers (lowest scores)
ZRANGE pilot_leaderboard 0 2 WITHSCORES

# Find specific pilot's rank (0-based, highest score = rank 0)
ZREVRANK pilot_leaderboard "Luke_Skywalker"
ZRANK pilot_leaderboard "Stormtrooper_TK421"

# Get pilot's score
ZSCORE pilot_leaderboard "Darth_Vader"

# Update scores (pilot improvement after training)
ZADD pilot_leaderboard 45.6 "Stormtrooper_TK421"

# Get pilots within accuracy range (elite squadron criteria)
ZRANGEBYSCORE pilot_leaderboard 90 100 WITHSCORES

# Count pilots in score range
ZCOUNT pilot_leaderboard 90 100
```
